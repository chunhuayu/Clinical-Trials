# assumption
* Linear regression is an analysis that assesses whether one or more predictor variables explain the dependent (criterion) variable.  The regression has five key assumptions:

       Linear relationship
       Multivariate normality
       No or little multicollinearity
       No auto-correlation
       Homoscedasticity
 
### A note about sample size.  
* In Linear regression the sample size rule of thumb is that the regression analysis requires at least 20 cases per independent variable in the analysis.
