#### Data sampling is a statistical analysis technique used to select, manipulate and analyze a representative subset of data points to identify patterns and trends in the larger data set being examined. It enables data scientists, predictive modelers and other data analysts to work with a small, manageable amount of data about a statistical population to build and run analytical models more quickly, while still producing accurate findings.
# Advantages and challenges of data sampling
* Sampling can be particularly useful with data sets that are too large to efficiently analyze in full
## for example
* In big data analytics applications or surveys. Identifying and analyzing a representative sample is more efficient and cost-effective than surveying the entirety of the data or population.
## An important consideration
* Is the size of the required data sample and the possibility of introducing a sampling error. In some cases, a small sample can reveal the most important information about a data set. In others, using a larger sample can increase the likelihood of accurately representing the data as a whole, even though the increased size of the sample may impede ease of manipulation and interpretation.
T# ypes of data sampling methods
> There are many different methods for drawing samples from data; the ideal one depends on the data set and situation. Sampling can be based on probability, an approach that uses random numbers that correspond to points in the data set to ensure that there is no correlation between points chosen for the sample. Further variations in probability sampling include:
* Simple random sampling: Software is used to randomly select subjects from the whole population.
* Stratified sampling: Subsets of the data sets or population are created based on a common factor, and samples are randomly collected from each subgroup.
Cluster sampling: The larger data set is divided into subsets (clusters) based on a defined factor, then a random sampling of clusters is analyzed.
* Multistage sampling: A more complicated form of cluster sampling, this method also involves dividing the larger population into a number of clusters. Second-stage clusters are then broken out based on a secondary factor, and those clusters are then sampled and analyzed. This staging could continue as multiple subsets are identified, clustered and analyzed.
* Systematic sampling: A sample is created by setting an interval at which to extract data from the larger population -- for example, selecting every 10th row in a spreadsheet of 200 items to create a sample size of 20 rows to analyze.
