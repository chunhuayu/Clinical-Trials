# The total deviance 
* D is the sum of its unit deviances: 
* It is a generalization of the idea of using the sum of squares of residuals in ordinary least squares to cases where model-fitting is achieved by maximum likelihood. 
### Deviance is a goodness-of-fit statistic for a statistical model 
* It has a similar role to residual variance from ANOVA in linear models (RSS).
# Expression
* D = 2[log-likelihood(saturated model) − log-likelihood(proposed model)].
### The saturated model 
* It is a model with a parameter for every observation so that the data are fitted exactly.
### Used for statistical hypothesis testing
* This expression of deviance is simply 2 times the log-likelihood ratio of the full model compared to the reduced model. 
* The deviance is used to compare two models – in particular in the case of generalized linear models (GLM) 
* It plays an important role in exponential dispersion models and generalized linear models.
