# The total deviance 
* D is the sum of its unit deviances: 
* Deviance is a goodness-of-fit statistic for a statistical model; 
* D = 2[log-likelihood(saturated model) − log-likelihood(proposed model)].
* the saturated model is a model with a parameter for every observation so that the data are fitted exactly.
* This expression is simply 2 times the log-likelihood ratio of the full model compared to the reduced model. 
* It is often used for statistical hypothesis testing. 
* It is a generalization of the idea of using the sum of squares of residuals in ordinary least squares to cases where model-fitting is achieved by maximum likelihood. 
* It plays an important role in exponential dispersion models and generalized linear models.
* The deviance is used to compare two models – in particular in the case of generalized linear models (GLM) where it has a similar role to residual variance from ANOVA in linear models (RSS).
