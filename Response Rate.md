# What's a Good Survey Response Rate?
* It can be difficult to predict the level of survey participation you will receive, since survey response rates vary widely and a variety of factors can impact them. 
* But if you investigate these factors you can take steps to improve your response rates, giving you more statistically relevant data and better ROI on your survey project.
* Here we’ll dive into the benchmark response rates for common survey types, the factors that often affect response rates, and how you can take steps to get more responses.
# Typical Response Rates for Common Survey Types
* Generally speaking, it’s preferable to get a high response rate (80% or higher) from a small, random sample rather than a low response rate from a larger pool of potential respondents. But even this general guideline breaks down when we look at the differences between survey audiences.
> Surveys that you distribute internally (i.e. to employees) generally have a much higher response rate than those distributed to external audiences (i.e. customers).
> Internal surveys will generally receive a 30-40% response rate (or more) on average, compared to an average 10-15% response rate for external surveys.
* The different motivation levels of these two audiences has a lot to do with the big swing in survey response rates.
* Your survey to employees is likely very well targeted (hopefully you designed it with the employees in mind), and they probably have a good reasons to fill it out (because the business should be making decisions based on their responses).
> External surveys, even to well-segmented groups of customers, won’t be often be able to reach just the right type of respondents. And no matter what incentive you choose it won’t appeal to everyone who receives your survey.
* Response rates can soar past 85% (about 43 responses for every 50 invitations sent) when the respondent population is motivated and the survey is well-executed. 
* Response rates can also fall below 2% (about 1 response for every 50 invitations sent) when the respondent population is less-targeted, when contact information is unreliable, or where there is less incentive or little motivation to respond.
