 # Residual sum of squares (RSS), 
 * also known as the __sum of squared residuals (SSR)__ or the __sum of squared errors of prediction (SSE)__. 
 * Is the sum of the squares of residuals (deviations predicted from actual empirical values of data). 
 * It is a measure of the discrepancy between the data and an estimation model. 
 * A small RSS indicates a tight fit of the model to the data.
 * It is used as an optimality criterion in parameter selection and model selection.
