## A binary variable is a variable with only two values. For example:
* 1 / 0.
* Yes / No.
* Success / Failure.
* Male / Female.
* Black / White

* Although binary variables are commonly used in statistics (i.e. for the binomial distribution), the term “binary variable” is seldom used. 
* This may be in part because it’s rare to come across a variable that only has two choices outside of a Bernoulli distribution.

* A binary variable is the same thing as a “bit” in computer science or a “truth value” in mathematical logic. 
* They are basically different names for the same thing, 
* much like statisticians call a Bell curve a “Normal Distribution” and physicists call it a “Gaussian distribution.”

## Types of Binary Variables
* Binary variables can be divided into two types: opposite and conjunct.
* Opposite binary variables are polar opposite, like “Success” and “Failure.” Something either works, or it doesn’t. There’s no middle ground.
* Conjunct binary variables aren’t opposites of each other. They have more of a grey area. 
For example, in the United States you can be affiliated with the Democrat or Republican parties. In real life though, most people aren’t staunchly republican or staunchly democrat. It’s common for people to flip flop between parties, agree with 20% of what the other party says (making them 20% of one party and 80% of the other) or even to identify as another party entirely, like the Green Party.
